## Abstract

Autism spectrum disorder has become a global public health problem. Accurate diagnosis and prediction of autism are of great significance to determine the appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan. Based on the ABIDE autism data, this study uses a graph neural network to conduct a research on autism identification in children. Our main process includes preliminary data preparation processing, diagnostic model design and experimental result validation. The preliminary data mainly includes four steps: (1) extraction of blood oxygenation level dependent signal (BOLD signal for short) in brain regions; (2) generation of brain function network connection matrix; (3) matrix binarization and (4) brain map topology storage. Our initial data has 884 fMRI brain maps (two labels are ASD and HC). After data processing, it can be displayed as data in Euclidean space and data in non-Euclidean space. For the former, we use the method based on machine learning for model architecture; for the latter, we start from the graph classification model and establish Various graph neural network models. We have performed some evaluation and analysis for each model. At the same time, we take into account the scale of the data volume and use a data augmentation model to further process the original data. After the enhancement, the amount of data has been expanded by three times. Our graph classification model GAT can achieve 68.9% accuracy, 57.1% recall and 80.0% true negative rate, and the GAT model with data enhancement can achieve 72.3% accuracy, 58.3% Recall and 82.4% true negative rate.

自闭症谱系障碍已成为全球性公共卫生问题，对自闭症进行准确的诊断以及预测病情，对于确定合适的诊疗方案具有重要的意义。本研究基于ABIDE自闭症数据集，使用图神经网络进行儿童自闭症识别研究。
我们的主要流程包含前期数据准备处理，诊断模型设计和实验结果验证。前期数据主要包括四个步骤：（1）大脑分区血氧合度依赖信号（Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent，简称 BOLD 信号）提取；（2）脑功能网络连接矩阵生成；（3）矩阵二值化；（4）脑图拓扑结构存储。我们的初始数据有884张fMRI脑图（两个标签分别是ASD和HC）。模型设计部分我们分别根据处理后不同的数据类型，进行了多种模型的设计。数据处理后可以展现为：欧几里得空间的数据和非欧几里得空间的数据。针对前者，我们使用基于机器学习的方法进行模型架构；针对后者，我们从图分类模型入手，建立了多种图神经网络模型。我们针对每种模型都进行了一定的评估与分析。同时，我们考虑到了数据量的规模问题，使用了数据增强模型对原始数据进行了进一步处理。增强后数据量扩充了三倍。
我们的图分类模型GAT能够达到68.9%的准确率、57.1%的召回率和80.0%的真负率,加入数据增强后的GAT模型能达到72.3%的准确率、58.3%的召回率和82.4%的真负率。
